Directions:

  For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the saying “Respect others, and you will be respected.” You can cite examples to illustrate your views. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.

参考范文：

  ==A saying goes that== “Respect others, and you will be respected”. ==Simple as the saying is==, its meaning is profound and thought-provoking. Evidently, it is meant to tell us that being respected by others is derived from respecting others.

  Actually, all men are born to be equal and respect or esteem is the basic need of men. In other words, people cannot live freely and comfortably without others’ respect or esteem. Taking a look around we can also find examples too many to enumerate. Don’t make a joke with others, like appearance, social status, health conditions, since everyone has the right to be respected as a member of the society. It is also a respectable behavior that there is no interruption when others are talking or doing work. Without respect, it is hard for one to gain friendship, confidence, trust and even happiness.

  Bring what has been discussed into consideration, respect matters in people’s mutual relationship. Respecting others shows one’s good upbringing and parenting. The more you respect others, the more you will be respected.

参考译文：

  俗话说:“尊重别人，别人才会尊重你。”这句话虽然简单，但它的含义却深刻而发人深省。显然，这是在告诉我们，被别人尊重是从尊重别人而来的。

  事实上，所有人生来都是平等的，尊重或尊重是人的基本需求。换句话说，没有别人的尊重和尊重，人们不能自由和舒适地生活。环顾四周，我们也会发现不胜枚举的例子。不要和别人开玩笑，比如外貌、社会地位、健康状况，因为每个人都有被尊重为社会一员的权利。当别人说话或工作时，不打扰别人也是一种值得尊敬的行为。没有尊重，一个人很难获得友谊，信心，信任，甚至幸福。

  考虑到所讨论的，尊重问题在人们的相互关系中。尊重他人体现了良好的教养和教养。你越尊重别人，别人就会越尊重你。
