**Attend College Abroad**

==There is no consensus among people as to whether==students should attend college at home or abroad. Some people ==hold the idea== that attending college at home ==is preferable==, because it saves you the trouble of leaving your native place and adjusting to a complete new environment. On the other hand, others ==maintain that== attending college abroad is a better option for students. ==Weighing the pros and cons==, I am inclined to agree with the latter.

==In the first place==,when you study abroad, you are exposed to a new culture and lifestyle, which ==broadens your horizon==, enriches your experience and even improves your language skills. ==In the second place==, far away from home, you may grapple with new problems that arise all by yourself, and thus acquire the ability to solve problems, not to mention the ability of self-reliance. Lastly, people who have studied abroad usually have an edge over those who haven’t in the competitive job market. Sometimes it is not people’s ability but their experience of studying abroad that helps them land a job.

All in all, with the improvement of people’s living standards, more and more people can afford to attend college abroad. I recommend that students pursue higher education abroad when an opportunity knocks.

人们对于学生应该在国内上大学还是在国外上大学没有共识。有些人认为，在国内上大学更好，因为这可以省去背井离乡去适应全新的环境的麻烦。另一方面，其他人认为，上国外大学对学生来说是一个更好的选择。权衡利弊之后，我倾向于同意后者。

首先，当你出国留学时，你会接触到一种新的文化和生活方式，这会拓宽你的视野、丰富你的经历，甚至提高你的语言能力。第二，远离家后，你可能会自己努力克服出现的新问题，从而获得解决问题的能力，更不用说自力更生的能力了。最后，在竞争激烈的就业市场上，有出国留学经历的人通常比那些没有出国留学经历的人更有优势。有时有助于一个人找到工作的不是他的能力，而是他在国外学习的经历。

总之，随着人们生活水平的提高，越来越多的人可以负担得起上国外大学。我建议学生当机会来敲门时去国外接受高等教育。
