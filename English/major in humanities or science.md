　　The ==heated discussion== about the best choice in selecting the major :humanities or science has never stopped in the past few years. ==Opinions on the topic vary greatly among people==. Some believe that it is a better choice to acquire knowledge in science, but others consider it better to ==dig into==the humanities.

　　As for me, I ==totally agree with== the former choice with the following reasons presented below. ==Initially==, one of the most important reasons cited by people is that to major in science can not only improve one’s==logical thinking ability== but also ==sharpen one’s insight in daily routine==,==which is of great importance in one’s growth==. Additionally, acquiring scientific knowledge contributes greatly to one’s success in this world with rapid development of science and technology.

　　From my perspective, it is ==crucial== that modern education should encourage people to ==be practitioners==. What’s more, one of the most critical factors we should ==take into consideration== is that people should understand the meaning and value of scientific knowledge. Only in this way can we achieve greater success.

　　在过去几年中，选择文科专业还是理科专业这个话题一直都是热议的话题。人们对这个话题意见不一。一些人认为理科是好的选择，而有些人认为文科是好选择。

　　对于我而言，我选择理科，有以下理由：首先，人们想到的选择理科最为重要的原因为，理科不仅可以提升一个人的逻辑能力，还可以自身在日常生活中的洞察力，这是非常有助于学生的成长的。而且，学习理科知识可以极大的帮助学生在这个科技快速发展的世界中获得成功。

　　从我的角度出发，现代教育鼓励学生成为实践者是非常关键的。而且，我们应该考虑到的重要原因之一是人们需要理解科学知识的重要意义。只有这样，我们才可以更好的获得成功。
