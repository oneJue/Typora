==Suppose individuals intend to acquire true knowledge, it is advisable for them to practice more.== ==Thus==, when hearing the remark “Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it.”, we can easily ==perceive its connotation==. ==Apparently==, this saying ==can be naturally associated with the close relationship between knowledge and practice==.
==Whether in the history or today, it is a common belief for people to consider== knowledge as a treasure. Meanwhile, an increasing number of scholars or wise men find it more  significance to practice knowledge, if they want to master it better. Two typical examples can be given: English language is a treasure which helps us to communicate with the world, but ==without== practice, it would be impossible to speak it fluently; science and technology is a treasure which pushes forward social development, but with no practice, it would be hard for scientists to innovate. ==It is practice that can enable== humans to combine valuable knowledge with reality. As a matter of fact, ==intelligent people in large numbers== have come to realize the significance of practice for knowledge.

==I, as a college student, am convinced that== it is of great necessity for teenagers to gain knowledge and it is of greater necessity to practice it more. Do bear in mind: practice makes perfect.

假如人们想获得知识，他们就应当明智地多进行实践。因此当我们听到这句评论“知识是一座宝库，而实践是开启宝库的钥匙”，我们就能够很容易地理解这句话的内涵。显然，这句话能被自然地联系到知识与实践之间的密切关系。
无论在历史上还是现在，人们普遍相信知识就是财富。同时越来越多的学者或智者发现如果他们想要掌握知识，实践更加重要。两个典型的例子如下：英语语言是个宝贝，它帮助我们与世界交流，但是如果不实践，英语不可能说的流利；科学技术是个宝库，它推动社会发展，但如果没有实践，科学家就很难创新。正是实践使得人类将知识和现实相结合。事实上，许多聪明人都已经开始意识到实践对于知识的重要性。
作为一名大学生，我相信年轻人有必要学习知识而且更有必要多多实践知识。牢记：熟能生巧。
