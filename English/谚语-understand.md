　　===There is a proverb going like this==, “Seek to understand others, and you will be understood.” Simple as the saying is, its implication deserves exploring. From my perspective, the real sense of the proverb lies in mutual understanding.

　　One of the reasons that mutual understanding is so vital is that it forms the basis of all friendships and relationships. Mutual understanding allows existing differences between two or more partied to be acknowledged, accepted and respected, so that common ground and a collective vision can be found. This is true regardless of whether the relationship is between individuals, businesses or even countries. For example, the US and British governments may not see eye to eye on every issue, but they have been able to put aside their differences and forge a friendship and alliance supported by their shared values. We may not fully agree with other people’s opinions or beliefs. However, by understanding the reasons behind their words and actions, we can learn to “disagree without being disagreeable”so that quarrels are averted.

　　Therefore, for those who wish to build lasting relationships, prevent conflict with others, seeking and achieving mutual understanding with others is not only important, but essential.

　　【参考译文】

　　谚语有云，“寻求理解他人，你就会被理解”。虽然这个谚语很简单，但是其内涵值得探索。在我看来，这个谚语的真正含义在于相互理解。

　　相互理解如此关键的原因之一是它是所有友谊和各种关系的基础。相互理解使得两方或多方已有的分歧被认可、接受和尊重，因此共同的立场和观点也得以形成。这一点不管是对个人之间还是公司间还是国家间的关系都是适用的。比如说美国和英国政府可能并不是每个问题上都意见完全一致，但他们可以放下分歧，在共同的价值观基础上形成友谊和联盟。我们可能不完全同意他人的观点或信念。不过通过了解他们言论和行为背后的原因，我们可以学着“表达不同意见，但仍保持友善态度”，从而避免争吵。

　　因此，对于那些希望建立长久关系，防止跟他人冲突的人来说，寻求并获得与他人相互理解不仅是重要的，而且是必要的。
