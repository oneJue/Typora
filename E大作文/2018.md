What springs from the drawing is such a scene :  The student is browsing the ‘Course Selection System’ website, looking for courses characterized by ‘give high grading’, ‘easy to pass’, and ‘minimal homework’. while  the suggestions or requirements for course selection are ‘new knowledge’, ‘emphasis on innovation’, and ‘challenging’. At the bottom of the cartoon is the caption which reads"Course Selection in Progress"

Common as it is at first glance, this picture is brimming with illumination after your serious pondering: individuals are bound to put value on  family education,which can be accounted for as follows. Initially，tremendous academic pressure  should shoulder the blame, which render students tend to alleviate burden on their own initiative. Simultaneously,the university ,supposed to play a crucial role in curbing these sorts of problems embodied in the drawing ,fail to exercise effective and strict supervision over course selection management. Last but not least,It is the lack of self-discipling and desire to advance that pushes students to do that, turning a deaf ear to the requirements of the university

Taking into account what has been argued, we can come to the conclusion that reading is overwhelmingly crucial, which needs more action to be done. As a cradle of talents, it is of significant importance for universities to enhance the young's independent thinking ability; that is to say, universities are bound to provide ample guidance for undergraduates setting good examples for others.
