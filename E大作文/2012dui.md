What springs from the drawing is such a scene :having seen a bottle overturned on the floor, spilling its liquid,one man falls into despair,sighing “all screwed up”,while the other man hurries to lift up the bottle,smiling as still have something left in the bottle. What an enlightening cartoon it is!

Not until I see this caricature, do I realize the magnitude of positive attitude, which can be interpreted by the three following aspects. Initially,the strain of modern life has exposed a Pandora's box of problems that individuals are becoming easier to be overwhelmed by negative emotions. Additional, as a saying goes that “It is never too late to mend” ,if If we do as the man on the right of the picture does, we won't lose everything even if we get into trouble. Finally, Anyone who is eager to be successful must realize that the way to success is full of obstacles and hardships, which will disappear in the face of optimistic attitude.

Taking into account what has been argued, we can come to the conclusion that positive attitude  is overwhelmingly crucial, which needs more action to be done.  As a cradle of talents, it is of significant importance for universities to exert a positive cultural influence on the public; that is to say, universities are bound to provide ample guidance for undergraduates setting good examples for others. Let's get prepared and embrace the harmonious and disciplined society constructed by our joint efforts.
