The above two pictures reveal two distinctly different habits. The girl in left pictures concentrate on her `assignments`, murmuring “Only I complete them as soon as possible can I feel at ease”,while the boy,lounging on a chair,shows(with) no intention of doing his work,saying“waiting until the last minute to make a start.“

Common as it is at first glance, this picture is brimming with illumination after your serious pondering: individuals are suppose to realize the importance of good habits. Initially,the undesirable general mood of society deserves to take the blame, ,which makes individuals more vulnerable to delay their assignments.
