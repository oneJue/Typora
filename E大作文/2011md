What springs from the drawing is such a scene : a weathered wooden boat, drifting across tranquil lake waters, carries passengers who casually discard trash and debris into the once-pristine waterway. Were it not for this polluting behavior,we would omit the widespread phenomenon of a general decline in moral quality. The caption at the bottom of the cartoon reads, “The ‘Remains’ of the Journey.”

This drawing goes straight to the core problem of the current society: the degradation of morality, the reasons of which will be set three as follows. Initially，the undesirable general mood of society should shoulder the blame, such as gradual loss of sense of social responsibility，morality and conscience and its like. Simultaneously,in light of the data published by the recent survey, 65% of folks, approximately, expresses their indifference towards environmental protection. Finally,The local administrations,supposed to play a crucial role in curbing these sorts of problems embodied in the drawing ,fail to exercise effective and strict supervision over polluting behavior.

Taking into account what has been argued, we can come to the conclusion that environment protection  is overwhelmingly crucial, which needs more action to be done. When intangible and tangible incentives are presented, environment protection will be considered a priority. Let's get prepared and embrace the harmonious and disciplined society constructed by our joint efforts.
