In reply to your request for introduce a traditional Chinese festival. After my careful consideration.I am going to introduce the Spring Festival,which is of great significance to all Chinese.

The Spring Festival, which has thousands of years of history, is the most important festival of the Chinese nation. When the Spring Festival is around the corner, people are busy purchasing goods,cleaning houses, cooking traditional food, and pasting couplets. It is worth mentioning that having the family reunion dinner is the most important activity on the New Year's Eve. Dumplings, which symbolize reunion and goodwill, are an indispensable part of the dinner.
I hope you can enjoy this festival, and I am looking forward to your coming to China for the Spring Festival.
