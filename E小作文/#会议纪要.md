This meeting was for the purpose of discussing how to      and finally all participant came to the same conclusion.

Professor Sky raised the question and pointed out that compared with the past, we enjoy a richer life and
thus an increasing number of youngsters do not cherish food. 

Then, all classmates agreed that this phenomenon is particularly worth attention. 

We deemed that it is of great necessity for us to stop wasting not only food, but also time, electricity, water and the like.
The conclusion is that we are supposed to take immediate actions to prevent food waste in daily life, such as
only buying what we need and not throwing away leftovers.
