Dear Professor Smith,
To improve students* abilities and enrich extracurricular activities, the Student Union of our university is organizing an international Al innovation conference. Given your achievements in the field, we cordially invite you to join us.
The conference is scheduled to start at 19:00 on December 30 in the Students* Recreational Center and it will last for approximately two hours. There will be a reception team at the main entrance of our school to help guests with the direction. More importantly, we sincerely invite you to deliver a speech on the advancement of Al of about half an hour, and I am sure your speech will be highly anticipated and very enlightening.
Thank you for your time and patience, and I look forward to your reply.
Warm regards,
Li Ming
