Dear Tom

In reply to your request for recommending a famous Chinese celebrity . After my careful consideration,I would like to Introduce Lu Xun to you, who is a great writer, thinker, and educator in modern China.

Here are several reasons why I introduce Lu Xun. To change the national spirit, he gave up studying medicine and concentrated on writing. The novels written by him, such as Diary of a Madman, Kong Yiji, and The True Story of Ah Q, have encouraged millions of Chinese people to move forward when meeting with setbacks. Most importantly,for a foreigner who wants to learn more about Chinese literature,reading his works is helpful for improving your sensitivity to Chinese. 

I hope you can read some of his works, and I am looking forward to your comments.
Yours sincerely,
Li Ming
