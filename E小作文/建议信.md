Dear President

I, as a senior from the Department of Economics, am writing to make several suggestions in regard to student physical fitness.

Initially, the fundamental approach is to continue an extensive education on social morality

Enacting well-enforced regulations  to curb inappropriate behavior in violation of public virtues should be high on the agenda of our government.

every efforts should be made to encourage people to step out of their comfort zones, and cultivate good habits to overcome hardships.

I hope that my advice will be beneficial for sth. If you have any ideas to exchange, please do not hesitate to contact me.
