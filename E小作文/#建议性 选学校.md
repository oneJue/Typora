Dear Jack
Thrilled to hear your plans to pursue higher education in China, I am reaching out to offer some advice.

Initially, ==choosing a university renowned== in your major ==is of cardinal importance==. I strongly suggest that you consult your professor about this. Besides, if you want to know the requirements for your application, you can visit the official website of the university you will apply to, and most colleges in China offer English versions to guide you. ==Additionally,== it might be a good idea for you to learn some basic Mandarin, since it can help you ease your nerves and blend in quickly. 

If you have any questions or need assistance, l' m just an email away.
Best regards,
Li Ming
