 Thrilled to hear your plans to learn Chinese, I am reaching out to provide some advice.

First, listening is of cardinal importance for learning languages, so I strongly suggest that you listen to Chinese pop songs and watch Chinese TV dramas,which can help improve your understanding of the Chinese language. Second,since Chinese is very different from English and self-study might be challenging, it is advisable to take some online courses. Additionally, practice is always the best strategy if you intend to master another language. A good way is to make Chinese friends and chat with them daily. I would love to be your partner in learning Chinese.

If you have any questions or need more help, I am just an email away.
