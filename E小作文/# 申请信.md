Dear Programme Coordinator,
I hope this email finds you well! My name is Li Ming, a senior student in XX university. I am writing to express my keen interest in the overseas exchange student programme.
I believe I am well-suited for this opportunity. First, my academic performance is consistently strong, and I have been awarded scholarships twice during my studies. Second, I am highly proficient in English, and I enjoy interacting with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Additionally, I am also actively involved in extracurricular activities, demonstrating my ability to balance multiple responsibilities while thriving in diverse environments. This program presents a unique opportunity for cultural exchange and personal growth, which I am eager to embrace.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your reply.
Best regards,
Li Ming
